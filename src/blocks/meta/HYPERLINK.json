The path can be to a file that is stored on a hard disk drive. The path can also be a universal naming convention (UNC) path on a server (in Microsoft Excel for Windows) or a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) path on the Internet or an intranet."

If friendly_name returns an error value (for example, #VALUE!), the cell displays the error instead of the jump text."
